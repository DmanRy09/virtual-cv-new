      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a hardworking, curious and dedicated individual willing to be challenged to grow my skillset. 
            I have an appetite to learn new technical skills, showcasing discipline that is needed to reach my ambitions. 
            Collaborative skills are my strong suit — able to show efficiency in communication with others, sometimes being able to naturally step up as a leader if necessary. 
            I know my way around a few programming languages such as Python, C and C++, C# and Java that have a wide range of uses from web development, data analytics, database design, and object-oriented programming.
            I have gained a good grasp of knowledge in database design and management, cybersecurity, networking design, GitHub, advanced Excel, and computer hardware usage.

            I am curious about a variety of topics. As aforementioned, I have an appetite to learn even in my hobbies. 
            I am intrigued by science, technology, and history. 
            Movies, gaming, anime, board/card games, comics/manga, and TV series are some of my hobbies I enjoy in my free time.
        </p>

                I am fluent in English and Afrikaans, and I have a good grasp of Sesotho, while being passively fluent in Zulu and Setswana.
